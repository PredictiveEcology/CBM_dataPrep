## Overview
[CBM_dataPrep](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep.git) processes spatially explicit inputs for use in [CBM_vol2biomass_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass_SK.git) and [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git). In *SpaDES-speak*, it has two events, the `init` event (scheduled once) and the `readDisturbanceEvents` which processes disturbances (usually provided as rasters) into a table format used in [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git). [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) was designed for spatially explicit modelling and provides a wide variety of tools to support it. [CBM_dataPrep](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep.git) makes use of these tools. We use an example that simulates a scenario where remotely-sensed disturbances are simulated in the managed forests of Saskatchewan from 1985 to 2011, as described in @boisvenue2016 (scenario = time horizon + disturbances).

## Background
The default structure of [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) modules has the [`.inputObjects`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#inputobjects) function, and in this function in [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git), we make use of the [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html) function, an important part of the [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) toolkit (see the [SpaDES training manual](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/) for more details), enabling repeatable continuous workflows. [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) falls back to the defaults CBM parameters for running the SK managed forests, unless alternative information is provided by the user. 

This module reads in various spatially explicit Canada-wide rasters that are processed and cropped to our study area defining `masterRaster`. The characteristics (projection, resolution, etc.) of this [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#masterRaster) are transferred to other rasters used in the simulation via the function [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html). All rasters are matched to the [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#masterRaster) using the [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html) function.

## Module functioning
[CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) has 4 events; `ReadCohorts`, `MatchSpecies`, and `MatchDisturbances`, which are run only once, and the `readDisturbanceEvents` event, which is repeated for each simulation year.

### `ReadCohorts`
This short event reads in the study area's spatial inputs from [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) and processes them into two tables, `cohortDT` and `standDT` to be used in [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core). 

### `MatchSpecies`
Here the module matches species in user provided data tables to get additional attributes, such as CBM-specific species IDs needed in later modules. 

### `MatchDisturbance`
This event matches disturbances event types to its appropriate CBM-specific disturbance type ID. 

### `readDisturbanceEvents`
This event serves to process disturbance events for each simulation year. Separating this processing from the other events enables dynamic linkages to disturbance models. However, in our example, disturbances are provided in the form of remotely-sensed disturbance rasters. This is the only event in this module that is run more than once. 

### Disturbances
There are 468 unique disturbance matrices identified in the defaults. Since root parameters and snag carbon transfer rates have hardwood and softwood specific rates, each disturbance has a hardwood and a softwood instance, which means we have 234 unique disturbances across Canada as defaults in this modelling system, one for hardwood and one for softwood. A user could add or modify the proportions transferred between pools to represent a disturbance. 
**Add a section on how one would modify the disturbance matrices**

There are a series of helper functions in [CBMutils](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils.git) to help users explore and navigate disturbance matrices: 
- [spuDist](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/25f9b873ed7c2303864fa1b2d9243b8a7e20663e/R/CBM-DB_disturbances.R#L275) for extracting the disturbances in a specific spatial unit,
- [simDist()](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/25f9b873ed7c2303864fa1b2d9243b8a7e20663e/R/CBM-DB_disturbances.R#L458) which lists the disturbances used in a simulation, and
- [seeDist()](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/25f9b873ed7c2303864fa1b2d9243b8a7e20663e/R/CBM-DB_disturbances.R#L388) which pulls out the proportions from source to sink pools.

Because growth curves can be identified by strata, multiple columns can be used to identify growth curves using the `curveID` object. In our example, only **gcids** is used.
